# Artifact–Paper Mapping

This document maps the **sections, tables, and analyses** in the paper  
*“Stakeholder-Centered Explainability for Code Generation Models”*  
to the corresponding artifacts provided in this repository.

The goal is to support **traceability, transparency, and reproducibility**.
